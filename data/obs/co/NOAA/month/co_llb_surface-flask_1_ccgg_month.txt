# comment:  ************ USE OF GML DATA ****************
# comment:  
# comment: These data are made freely available to the public and the
# comment: scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
# comment: will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
# comment: The availability of these data does not constitute publication
# comment: of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to
# comment: ensure that GML receives fair credit for their work.  If the data 
# comment: are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, 
# comment: GML should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.  
# comment: If the GML data are essential to the work, or if an important 
# comment: result or conclusion depends on the GML data, co-authorship
# comment: may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in
# comment: the work.  Manuscripts using the GML data should be sent to GML
# comment: for review before they are submitted for publication so we can
# comment: ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately
# comment: represented.
# comment: Please see accompanying README file, if available, for citation text.
# comment:  
# comment: Every effort is made to produce the most accurate and precise
# comment: measurements possible.  However, we reserve the right to make
# comment: corrections to the data based on recalibration of standard gases
# comment: or for other reasons deemed scientifically justified.
# comment: 
# comment: We are not responsible for results and conclusions based on use
# comment: of these data without regard to this warning.

# comment:  ************ RECIPROCITY AGREEMENT ***************
# comment: 
# comment: Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.
# comment: Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their
# comment: own data available to the general public and to the scientific
# comment: community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.
# comment: Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,
# comment: upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation
# comment: of the GML data, namely well documented model code, transport
# comment: fields, modeled mole fractions, and additional information 
# comment: necessary for other scientists to repeat the work and to run 
# comment: modified versions. Model availability includes collaborative 
# comment: support for new users of the models.
